# printf()

The printf project is a collaborative effort by [***Daniel Korir***](https://github.com/Korir007) and [***Kevin Koech***](https://github.com/kevinkoech357), students of the ALX Software Engineering Programme, in which a function named "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".

**_printf()** is a function that performs formatted output conversion and prints data. Its prototype is the following:

        int _printf(const char *format, ...)

Where format contains the string that is printed. As **_printf()** is variadic function, it can receives n arguments that replace by n tags written inside the string.
